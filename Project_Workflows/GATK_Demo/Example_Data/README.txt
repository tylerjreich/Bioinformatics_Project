Running the Workflow (Sample Data)

To test this workflow without your own sequencing data, you can use publicly available sample data. This section provides links to download the necessary test data and reference genomes can be found under the "Reference_Genomes" folder.

Sample FASTQ/BAM Data:
These are low-coverage whole-genome sequencing reads for NA12878

Sample reads (FASTQ/BAM):
NA12878 test data – HiSeq 2500, 200k reads

Download the sample BAM or FASTQ files.
Place them in your project directory.
