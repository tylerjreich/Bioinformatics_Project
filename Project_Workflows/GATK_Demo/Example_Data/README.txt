Running the Workflow (Sample Data)

To test this workflow without your own sequencing data, you can use publicly available sample data. This section provides links to download the necessary test data and reference genomes can be found under the "Reference_Genomes" folder.

Sample FASTQ/BAM Data:
These are low-coverage whole-genome sequencing reads for NA12878

Sample reads (FASTQ/BAM):
NA12878 test data – HiSeq 2500, 200k reads

Download the sample BAM or FASTQ files.
Place them in your project directory.

The 2 files in this folder are outputs from the GATK workflow. 
If following the workflow from the beginning, these files will also be generated and do not need to be imported.
If checking the workflow from a specific stage, these files can be used.

1. test_metrics.txt
Purpose: This file is generated by the MarkDuplicates step in GATK (or Picard) and contains summary statistics about duplicate reads in the BAM file.
Description: Reports the number of reads examined, the number of duplicate reads identified, and related metrics describing library complexity and duplication rates. These metrics are useful for quality control, as high duplication rates may indicate PCR bias or low        library complexity.
When it is used:
  To verify that duplicate marking was performed successfully
  To assess sequencing and library quality
  For record-keeping and reproducibility

2. ref_contigs.txt
Purpose: This file contains a list of reference genome contigs and their lengths and is used to ensure consistency between the reference genome and BAM file headers.
Description: Derived from the reference genome FASTA index (.fai) and is used during BAM reheadering to ensure that contig names and ordering in the BAM file match those in the reference genome. This step is critical for compatibility with GATK, which requires exact   agreement between BAM headers and the reference sequence dictionary.
When it is used:
  During BAM header correction or reheadering
  To resolve contig mismatches between BAM files and the reference genome
  To prevent downstream GATK errors related to reference inconsistencies
