This directory contains a complete, end-to-end demonstration of a GATK-based variant calling workflow designed for low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (lcWGS) data. The purpose of this demo is to provide a fully documented, reproducible pipeline that can be tested using publicly available sample data and reference genomes before being applied to experimental datasets.

The workflow is configured to run on Linux or Windows via WSL2 (Ubuntu) and includes all necessary instructions for installing required tools, acquiring example data, and executing each step of the GATK pipeline.
This demo serves as the upstream component of the project, generating high-quality genotype likelihoods and VCF files that can subsequently be used for QTL mapping in R/qtl.

File and Folder Descriptions:

1. README_Project_Workflow_GATK.txt - This file contains the complete GATK workflow documentation, including:
  Instructions for setting up WSL2 and Ubuntu on Windows
  Installation and verification of required tools (GATK, Samtools, BCFtools, BWA, Java)
  Links to publicly available example sequencing data
  Links to example reference genomes

  Step-by-step commands for:
    Sorting and indexing BAM files
    Marking duplicates and adding read groups
    Indexing reference genomes
    Running GATK HaplotypeCaller in GVCF mode
    Genotyping GVCFs into final VCF files
    Notes on expected outputs and quality control checks

This file serves as the primary guide for running the GATK portion of the project from start to finish.

2. Tools_Required/ - This folder contains documentation and resources for downloading and installing all required software tools used in the workflow, including:
  GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit)
  Picard
  Samtools
  BCFtools
  Java (OpenJDK)

  Where applicable, installation commands for Linux/WSL2 are provided, along with links to official documentation and download pages.

3. Example_Data/ - This folder contains resources for obtaining and testing the workflow with publicly available sample data, including:
  Links to low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data for NA12878
  Example BAM/FASTQ files for proof-of-concept testing
  Two example output files:
    test_metrics.txt — duplicate metrics generated by MarkDuplicates
    ref_contigs.txt — reference contig list used for BAM header correction

  These files allow users to:
    Validate individual steps of the workflow
    Resume the pipeline from an intermediate stage
    Verify correct tool installation and expected outputs

4. Reference_Genomes/ - This folder provides resources and links for downloading example reference genomes required to run the workflow, including:
  Human reference genome FASTA files
  Associated index files (.fai, .dict, BWA index files)
  Notes on required reference genome formats for compatibility with GATK

  These references are intended for testing and demonstration purposes and can be replaced with organism-specific reference genomes for experimental data.

Intended Use - This GATK demo workflow is designed to:
  Validate the variant calling pipeline prior to analysis of experimental data
  Demonstrate correct tool installation and environment configuration
  Produce VCF and genotype likelihood files suitable for downstream analysis
  Serve as a reusable template for future lcWGS projects

Downstream Analysis:
  The outputs generated by this workflow are intended for use in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. 
  A fully annotated R/qtl workflow for importing VCF-derived genotypes, performing genome scans, and estimating QTL effects is provided separately in the R/qtl_Demo folder:
